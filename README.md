The **GEDKeeper** program is for working with personal genealogical databases.

The program is designed with an extremely simple and intuitive interface. 
It is very easy to install on your computer and provides many features including,
but not limited to, the following:
* Full support of the GEDCOM 5.5.1 standard.
* No restrictions on the number of persons and generations.
* Allows pedigree generation.
* Can build several tree species, as well as print and save their images.
* Provides fast navigation, filtering, and searching.
* Able to add multimedia materials.
* An output of geographic data using [GoogleÂ© maps](https://maps.google.com).

The aim of this program is to be a quick and effective means of conducting personal 
genealogical database development.

To enhance the capabilities of the program it supports scripts using Lua and plug-ins written in .NET.
