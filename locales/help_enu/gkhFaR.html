    <h1>Find and Replace</h1>

    <p>
        This function searches for a given string and replaces it with another value.
        In the current implementation, the search is performed only in personal records, only in names, fact values
        and associations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two types of additional options are supported: case-sensitive and wildcards.
        With the case-sensitive option enabled, the search will only be performed
        if the case of the characters in the search string exactly matches.
        With the wildcard option enabled, the search will take into account the
        <a href="gkhMasks.html">filter masks</a> in the search string.
    </p>

    <p>
        Attention: Before using this function, it is recommended to make a backup copy of the database file.
        When using mass replacement, it is recommended to first make a replacement in one or two cases
        and only if everything matches the expected - perform the replacement everywhere.
