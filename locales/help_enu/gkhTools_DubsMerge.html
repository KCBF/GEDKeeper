    <h1>Tools: Merging records</h1>

    <p>
        This tool removes duplicates among persons in the database.
        The tool shows a prompting window where you must select a record to remain
        and a record to delete (or give this choice to GEDKeeper).
        When the removed person has links, they may be moved into the remaining person.
    </p>

    <p>
        When two records are combined into one (merging records), all data for persons is combined without substitution and without distortion -
		pure addition. This means that if each person had links to parents - the combined person will receive
		two links to the families of parents. This is not an error situation and is acceptable by the standard.
		The reason is simple - one person can have a link to the family of biological parents, a link to the family of guardians,
		a link to the family of adoptive parents and other subtypes. Accordingly, there may be a situation when the search came to one person
		in the database from two different sides and the person was entered twice: for example, once as a child with his biological
		parents, and the second time as an adult, with information about the adoptive parents and his own family.
		When merging, a single record will receive all this information, after which it only needs to be checked and sorted.

    <p>
        It is recommended to search for duplicates with &quot;Check the year of birth&quot; option turned on
        (from the &quot;Options&quot; tab). This reduces the number of false operations.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Search for duplicate persons can be carried out with the option of indistinct matching of names
    	with a specified inaccuracy enabled - this will allow you to find different variants with slight
    	differences in the spelling of the name.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tool also processes notes, families, and sources.
