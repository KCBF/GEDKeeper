    <h1>Maps</h1>

    <p>
        Using a map service allows GEDKeeper to show you locations of births, deaths,
        and living, defined in database, right on a map.
    </p>

    <p>
        A number of providers are used to display maps: Google, Yandex, OpenStreetMap, Bing, WikiMapia.
        To change the provider, use the "Providers" button on the window toolbar.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maps can be saved to a image file using the <img src="../help/images/iSaveImage.gif"> button on the toolbar.
    </p>

    <p>
        To load places from database records, use the "Load places" button. This is the main mode,
        when the map window is called from the "Pedigree" menu of the main application window.
        Places are loaded according to the selected parameters on the left panel. It can be either the
        output of the selected type of place of birth, death or residence of all persons;
        or the output of places of any facts of a single selected person.
    </p>

    <p>
        If in the options (menu Service\Options), on the tab "Interface\Locations and Maps", the option
        "Search in geocoders of places without coordinates" is not enabled, then when loading places of various facts,
        the presence of a place in the directory of location records will be checked and places without coordinates will be
        skipped. If the option is enabled, then all places without coordinates will be checked by the selected geocoding
        provider and the names of the found coordinate options will be compared. Loading places with coordinate search is a
        slow process. It is recommended to use places entered in the directory of locations and with specified coordinates.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <p>
        The following modes assume that the locations is maintained in accordance with the GEDCOM 5.5 EL standard -
        i.e. locations form a hierarchy in which historical names of locations are specified at each level
        (City/District/Region/Country), with the period of validity of these names, and each location has a list of top-level
        locations, also with the period of validity of subordination.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When calling maps from the location records information panel, the specified location is selected
            from the person facts, locations are filtered to exclude duplicates and exclude locations without coordinates.
            Two submodes are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "Map of places " - all lower, subordinate places of the current place (District, Region or Country)
                    are identified and displayed on the map.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Map of persons" - all subordinates are identified at the current location, then people are identified
                    who have all detected locations indicated. All location marks with persons are displayed on the map.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            When calling maps from the person tree menu, all places are selected from the person tree facts,
            the places are filtered to exclude duplicates and exclude places without coordinates. After that,
            they are displayed on the map with a list of persons who were in the places on the map.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
    <p>
        Before calling the map service, you can filter persons
        using the general GEDKeeper filters.
