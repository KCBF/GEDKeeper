    <h1>A link to a source</h1>

    <p>
        A link to a source is a specialized link valid only for person, family,
        and event records, that binds to a concrete <a href="gkhRec_Source.html">information source</a>. A link to a source has
        two additional properties: page or sheet number where the mentioning
        was made, and certainty level for the information.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/dlgSrcLinkEdit.gif" alt="source citation dialog"></p>

    <p>
        Having page or sheet number is helpful when you need to review the source again.
    </p>

    <p>
        An certainty level quickly shows you how much you can trust a source of
        information. When a source document has blots or damages, and
        you could not have read the text with assurance, you might assign the
        &quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; level to such a source.
        This can prevent you from false conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Certainty level also affects the <a href="gkhCAIndex.html">certainty index</a>, which is calculated for
        a person in a <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a> module to analyze
        arithmetic mean values. <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">Tree diagrams</a> use the
        certainty level to make displayed information more obvious.
