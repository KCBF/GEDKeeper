    <h1>Tools: Check database</h1>

    <p>
        This tool checks information correctness in the database. It checks three
        types of records: family, person and media. Unlike typical database integrity
        checking, which is run every time you open a database and which checks
        the database structure, this tool handles logical errors and data
        inaccuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
        To pass the check, a family record must have assigned husband, wife,
        children, and events. When an empty family is found, the tool proposes
        to remove it. It is normal in practice to create a family from
        people, which might later be discovered, are from different
        families and were added erroneously. In these cases, GEDKeeper can
        move people from one family to another. After such actions a family record
        may lose all relations. This is a likely situation when you actively
        process large amounts of information.
    </p>

    <p>
        A person record is checked in the following way: the tool checks the
        death event, taking the maximal, scientifically confirmed age into
        account, checks and notifies about people without an explicitly defined
        sex, notifies about incorrect lifetime dates (for example, death date
        is before birth date), notifies about persons that were married before
        or after reasonable limits, or that have children who were born out of
        reasonable limits. When a person has no sex, the tool marks the record as being
        changed and opens the sex editor dialog. When a person&#39;s age exceeds
        the maximum one, the tool adds a death event without a specified date to the
        person record.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to checking the correctness of data and relationships in family and personal records,
        diagnostics of the presence of cyclic (ring) relationships are also performed.
        This is when, during the process of researching and replenishing the database, an erroneous situation arose with
        determining the required record by name and one of the ancestors
        was mistakenly entered as a child in the family of his descendants (at any depth).
        In this case, the tool will show the identifiers of the records that form a "cycle".
    </p>

    <p>
        Multimedia records are checked for presence in the "archive" or "storage",
        correctness of absolute and relative links.
    </p>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper fixes the lack of a death event, lack of a sex declaration, and may
        remove empty family records. All other issues are shown only for your information.
