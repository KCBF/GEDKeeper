# How to contribute

No code is perfect and we always welcome third-party patches. This document describes guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can accept their pull requests.

## Getting started

- Make sure you have an account on this site,
- Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exists.
    - Write in English,
    - Use the imperative mood in the subject/title field,
    - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug,
    - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
- Fork the repository on this site and `git-clone(1)` it locally.

## Making changes

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work,
- Make your changes taking [style guide](CODINGSTYLE.md) into account,
- Check for whitespace errors issuing `git diff --check`, `git diff --cached --check` or `git diff HEAD --check`,
- Make commits writing good [commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/),

## Submitting changes

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository,
- Submit a pull request to the project's repository,
- Update your ticket to mark you have submitted code and are ready for it to be reviewed. Include a link to the pull request in the ticket.

# How to build GEDKeeper

## Dependencies

### Building

* Microsoft [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) 4.7.1
* Microsoft [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or later

### Testing
* [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit) 2.6.4 or 3 (unit testing framework for .NET)

### Packaging

* [7-zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/) compression
* Nullsoft Scriptable Install System ([NSIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/)) 3.04

## For Windows

Run the script `build_all.mswin.x86.cmd` from the Windows command line.

Optionally pass the `release` option to the script to build without
debugging information. By default the script builds the executable with
embedded debugging information. The script skips testing for non-debug
builds.

## For Mono

Run the script `build_all.linux.x64.sh` from the Linux shell.


# The GEDKeeper testing

GEDKeeper uses [NUnit 2.6.4 or 3](http://www.nunit.org/), patches should come with 
tests and all tests should pass before a commit or branch is merged.


### Quick start Windows command line

 - Download the [NUnit binaries](http://github.com/nunit/nunitv2/releases/download/2.6.4/NUnit-2.6.4.zip), unzip and add to your path
 - Build GEDKeeper project (usually in Visual Studio or SharpDevelop)
 - `nunit-console-x86.exe projects\GKTests\bin\Debug\GKTests.dll`


### Quick start Mono command line

 - Download the [NUnit binaries](http://github.com/nunit/nunitv2/releases/download/2.6.4/NUnit-2.6.4.zip), unzip and place somewhere accessible
 - Build GEDKeeper project (usually in Xamarin Studio or MonoDevelop)
 - `mono somewhere/nunit-console ./projects/GKTests/bin/Debug/GKTests.dll`

### Running Unit Tests in the IDE

NUnit is not incredibly robust in the IDEs at present, so results are mixed 
but here are some suggestions.

In **Visual Studio**, NUnit has an integrated Visual Studio add-in which can be 
downloaded from their website and used to run tests in the Test Explorer pane.

In **SharpDevelop**, in the Unit Tests window, you can right click on any test, 
and then `Run tests`, which will allow everything to work.
