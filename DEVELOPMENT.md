# How to build GEDKeeper

## Dependencies

### Building

* Microsoft [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) 4.7.2
* Microsoft [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or later

### Testing
* [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit) 2.6.4 or 3 (unit testing framework for .NET)

### Packaging

* [7-zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/) compression
* Nullsoft Scriptable Install System ([NSIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/)) 3.04

## For Windows

Run the script `build_all.mswin.x86.cmd` from the Windows command line.

Optionally pass the `release` option to the script to build without
debugging information. By default the script builds the executable with
embedded debugging information. The script skips testing for non-debug
builds.

## For Mono

Run the script `build_all.linux.x64.sh` from the Linux shell.


# The GEDKeeper testing

GEDKeeper uses [NUnit 2.6.4 or 3](http://www.nunit.org/), patches should come with 
tests and all tests should pass before a commit or branch is merged.


### Quick start Windows command line

 - Download the [NUnit binaries](http://github.com/nunit/nunitv2/releases/download/2.6.4/NUnit-2.6.4.zip), unzip and add to your path
 - Build GEDKeeper project (usually in Visual Studio or SharpDevelop)
 - `nunit-console-x86.exe projects\GKTests\bin\Debug\GKTests.dll`


### Quick start Mono command line

 - Download the [NUnit binaries](http://github.com/nunit/nunitv2/releases/download/2.6.4/NUnit-2.6.4.zip), unzip and place somewhere accessible
 - Build GEDKeeper project (usually in Xamarin Studio or MonoDevelop)
 - `mono somewhere/nunit-console ./projects/GKTests/bin/Debug/GKTests.dll`

### Running Unit Tests in the IDE

NUnit is not incredibly robust in the IDEs at present, so results are mixed 
but here are some suggestions.

In **Visual Studio**, NUnit has an integrated Visual Studio add-in which can be 
downloaded from their website and used to run tests in the Test Explorer pane.

In **SharpDevelop**, in the Unit Tests window, you can right click on any test, 
and then `Run tests`, which will allow everything to work.
